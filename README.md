## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

This layout seemed relatively simple at first, but as I worked on it, there were some fun challenges when it came to rearranging the HTML to create the different layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. I started by only looking at the mobile device design, and after I finished that, I looked at the other designs. This caused me some issues because I had split up the sections in ways that made me have to copy and paste code in a few places and mark the originals as "hidden" using Tailwind to be able to get the layout right. I'm sure that if I had taken a moment to look at the other designs, I could have done things better. It taught me that I need to look at all the designs first and take a few minutes to plan what I am going to do before just jumping head first into the development phase. The most annoying part was trying to get the orange overlay on the image without using Photoshop. I wasn't able to get it exactly like the initial design, but I'm happy with the result.


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on detailed documentation and keeping my projects cleaner and more optimally layed out. I definitely feel like I made some progress in my skills during this project.
